# JS-Fundamentals

Welcome to the **JS-Fundamentals** repository!  
This repository contains beginner-level JavaScript scripts developed as part of a week-long project to master the core concepts of the language. The project focuses on using JavaScript both for scripting (similar to Python) and web front-end development.

## 📅 Project Timeline

- **Start Date:** May 19, 2025 – 12:00 AM  
- **Deadline:** May 26, 2025 – 12:00 AM  
- **Checker Released:** May 19, 2025 – 12:00 AM  
- An automatic review will be launched at the deadline.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to confidently explain and demonstrate the following concepts:

### ✅ General JavaScript Knowledge
- Why JavaScript is a powerful and amazing programming language.
- How to run a JavaScript script.
- How to declare variables and constants.
- The differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- JavaScript data types and how to work with them.
- Control flow with `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `break`, and `continue`.
- How to use comments in JS.
- Functions: definition, usage, return values, and scope.
- Operators and operator precedence.
- Working with dictionaries (objects) and arrays.
- Importing files and using module patterns.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each script corresponds to a specific task with increasing complexity. All scripts are written in JavaScript and use `console.log(...)` for output. **`var` is not used.**

| File                      | Description                                |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `0-javascript_is_amazing.js` | Prints “JavaScript is amazing” using `const`. |
| `1-multi_languages.js`      | Prints 3 programming languages.           |
| `2-arguments.js`            | Prints messages based on the number of command-line arguments. |
| `3-value_argument.js`       | Prints the first argument or “No argument”. |
| `4-concat.js`               | Prints two arguments in a sentence.       |
| `5-to_integer.js`           | Converts an argument to an integer or prints an error message. |
| `6-multi_languages_loop.js` | Uses a loop and array to print 3 messages. |
| `7-multi_c.js`              | Prints “C is fun” x times based on input. |
| `8-square.js`               | Prints a square of X characters.          |
| `9-add.js`                  | Adds two integers using a custom `add` function. |

## 🚀 Requirements

- All files are executable scripts intended to be run using Node.js.
- No use of `var` is allowed; only `let` or `const` should be used.
- The use of external libraries is not required.
- Each file is standalone and demonstrates a single concept.

## 🧪 How to Run

To execute a script:

```bash
node <filename.js>
```
For example, to run the first script:
